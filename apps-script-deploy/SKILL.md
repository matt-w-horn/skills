description: Push-first deploy ritual for Google Apps Script projects deployed with clasp. Use whenever deploying, pushing, or verifying Apps Script code — "deploy this", "push to Apps Script", "clasp push" — and whenever the deployed Apps Script code looks stale, reverted, or doesn't match the local source.

# Apps Script deploy (push-first)

Local TypeScript is the source of truth: esbuild bundles `src/` into `dist/main.gs` and `clasp push` uploads it. The Apps Script web editor is never edited directly. The recurring failure mode (it has silently clobbered deploys before) is a **stale editor browser tab**: an open editor session can save its old copy over a fresh push, and a cached tab can make a good deploy look stale during verification.

## The ritual

1. **Ask the user to close any open Apps Script editor tabs before pushing.** This is the step that prevents the silent-revert bug; don't skip it because the push "should" win.
2. **Build:** `npm run build` (tsc --noEmit + esbuild bundle). A failed build means nothing ships.
3. **Preview the push:** `npx clasp status` to list exactly which files would upload — expect only the bundle and `appsscript.json` (`.claspignore` whitelists just those).
4. **Push:** `npm run push` (build + `clasp push` in one step).
5. **Verify in a fresh tab:** `npx clasp open-script`, then confirm the change is present (spot-check a changed line or run the relevant entry point). Never verify in a tab that was already open — cached editors have shown stale code minutes after a successful push.

## If the remote looks stale or reverted

- Re-push once (`npm run push`) and re-verify in another fresh tab.
- If it reverts _again_, an editor session somewhere is saving over the push — find and close it (other machines and browser windows count), then push once more.
- To inspect what the remote actually holds, prefer `npx clasp status`; if you must `clasp pull`, remember it overwrites the local `dist/` copy — pull, diff against the built bundle, then rebuild to restore local truth.
- Never reconcile by editing in the web editor. Fix locally, rebuild, push.

## Per-repo specifics

This is the shared ritual. Each project's own details live in **that repo's `CLAUDE.md`** — check there before deploying an unfamiliar one:

- whether `.clasp.json` is committed (scriptId only, no secrets) or gitignored;
- the exact entry-point function names that must stay exported from `main.ts` **and** listed in the `build.js` global footer (renaming one silently breaks the time trigger that calls it by name);
- the OAuth scopes — changing `oauthScopes` makes the next run re-prompt Google authorization.
